		<h2>The Old System:</h2>
		<p>This whole project was created in response to Oficcial University of St. Thomas registration system during the fall semseter of 2018. During this time the official system showed itself to be lacking features and glacially slow while underload(page updates taking upwards of 10 minutes). After dealing with this mess of a system We, as a class decided to remake it. And this is our new, improved registration system.</p>

		<h2>What our system improved on:</h2>
			<br>

			<h3>One Page vs. Many</h3>
			<p>One our primary issues with Murphy online is how slow it can be. This is is partially due to how many page transitions take place. Searching for classes, viewing course descriptions, and actually registering all takes place on seperate pages. These numerous page transitions contribute to Murphy's glacial speed.</p>

			<p>In comparison system allows student to search, register and read course descriptions all on the same page. We do this by making liberal use of drop down menus. Having the description and registration button for each course contained in a drop down menu allows students to see all the information they need while remaining on the same page</p>

			<h3>Colorization</h3>
			<p>Unlike murphy online where there is no way to at a glance determine if you are already registered into a particular section our system implements color coding. by coloring sections the student are already registered/waitlisted for students are given a more immediate understanding of how new classes fit into their current schedule.</p>
