		<h2>The Old System:</h2>
		<p>This whole project was created in response to Oficcial University of St. Thomas registration system during the fall semseter of 2018. During this time the official system showed itself to be lacking features and glacially slow while underload(page updates taking upwards of 10 minutes). After dealing with this mess of a system We, as a class decided to remake it. And this is our new, improved registration system.</p>

		<h2>What our system improved on:</h2>
